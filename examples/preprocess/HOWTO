Under any subfolder, the following command will do the preprocessing and
generate a .h5m/vtk file:

$ python -m elliptic.Preprocess <config>

Replacing <Preprocessor> with the desired module and <config> with the config file.

For example, under the multiscale example folder, run the following command:
$ python -m elliptic.Preprocess structured.cfg

If you are running on Docker you you should have pulled the image gpkc/elliptic.
Start docker
$ sudo systemctl start docker
run docker as follows
$ sudo docker run -v $PWD:/elliptic gpkc/elliptic bash -c "cd /elliptic; python -m elliptic.Preprocess <config>"

For example, under the upscale example folder, run the following command:
$ sudo docker run -v $PWD:/elliptic gpkc/elliptic bash -c "cd /elliptic; python -m elliptic.Preprocess structured.cfg"
